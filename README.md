![echo.go - the simple out-of-memory exception generator](res/logo.png)

echo.go ðŸ’¨ is an out-of-memory exception generator written in go ðŸ’¨ as a companion to [hello-world.rs](https://github.com/mTvare6/hello-world.rs.git). since it's in go ðŸ’¨ the code is simpler, shorter, and easier to read and portable and good package management compared to c(rap) or rus(hi)t! binaries are only 1.9 million bytes each ðŸ’¨

## Installation

echo.go ðŸ’¨ can be installed by downloading the most recent source code release and choosing the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture and copying it to the appropriate application directory ðŸ’¨

## Building from source

Obtain the source with a git clone or download a release tarball. To use the deployment script you will need to have go ðŸ’¨ and bash with commands echo, cut, mkdir. If you just want to build for your OS you just need go ðŸ’¨

### Cross-system deployment

A script is provided, build.sh to invoke go ðŸ’¨ build for all the available target architectures. make sure you are in the project root directory:

    ./build.sh

Binaries (only 1.9 MB each, a total of just ~82 MB ðŸ’¨) will be located in the dist/ folder.

### Local build

    go ðŸ’¨ build -o echo src/main.go ðŸ’¨

## Usage

    (arch)-echo [args]

The program will then ignore your arguments and output a long memory exception trace ðŸ’¨
